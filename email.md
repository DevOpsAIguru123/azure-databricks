### Subject: Recommended CIDR Updates for Azure Network Architecture

Hi [Recipient's Name],

I hope you're doing well. I’ve analyzed our current Azure network CIDR allocations and recommend some adjustments for scalability, future growth, and to avoid potential IP conflicts. Below is a comparison of our existing network setup with my recommended CIDR ranges.

**Current Network CIDR Allocations**:

| VNet                         | CIDR Block       | Subnet Name                | Subnet CIDR Block   | Purpose                                |
|------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Hub VNet**                  | `10.0.0.0/16`    | Firewall Subnet            | `10.0.1.0/26`       | Network firewall                       |
| **Spoke 1 (Databricks)**      | `192.168.0.0/16` | Public Subnet              | `192.168.64.0/19`   | Databricks public                      |
|                              |                  | Private Subnet             | `192.168.32.0/19`   | Databricks private                     |
| **Spoke 2 (Azure AI)**        | -                | -                          | -                   | Not yet allocated                      |
| **Spoke 3 (Storage & KeyVault)** | -              | -                          | -                   | Not yet allocated                      |

**Why 10.x.x.x Instead of 192.168.x.x?**
- **Scalability**: The **10.x.x.x range** provides significantly more IP addresses and flexibility for large-scale environments, unlike **192.168.x.x**, which is limited to smaller spaces (65,536 IPs total).
- **Avoiding IP Conflicts**: **192.168.x.x** is commonly used in on-premises networks (home networks, small offices), increasing the risk of conflicts when establishing hybrid connectivity (VPN/ExpressRoute).
- **Future Expansion**: **10.x.x.x** offers broader ranges that accommodate future growth and additional subnets without requiring major reconfiguration.

Please let me know if you’d like to discuss this further.
