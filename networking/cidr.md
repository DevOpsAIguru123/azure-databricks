To allocate more IP addresses to the **Hub VNet** and include an **Azure AI Services VNet**, here’s the revised plan. I’ll assign a larger range for the Hub VNet and introduce the Azure AI Services VNet, maintaining separation between Databricks, Storage & Key Vault, and AI services.

### 1. **Hub VNet Configuration (Increased IP Allocation)**
   The **Hub VNet** needs more IP addresses for future growth and shared services. I'll allocate a larger block, such as **/22**, providing more IP space.

   - **Hub VNet**: `10.4.0.0/22` (4,096 IP addresses)

#### Subnets within the Hub VNet:
   - **Firewall Subnet**: `10.4.0.0/24` (254 IP addresses)
   - **Gateway Subnet** (if needed): `10.4.1.0/24` (254 IP addresses)
   - **Shared Services Subnet** (for DNS, monitoring, etc.): `10.4.2.0/23` (512 IP addresses)

### 2. **Spoke 1: Databricks VNet Configuration**
   No changes to the Databricks VNet allocation. It’s already designed for large-scale Databricks deployments.

   - **Databricks VNet**: `10.0.0.0/14` (262,144 IP addresses)

#### Subnets within Databricks VNet:
   - **Public Subnet**: `10.0.0.0/16` (65,536 IP addresses)
   - **Private Subnet**: `10.1.0.0/16` (65,536 IP addresses)
   - **Private Endpoints Subnet**: `10.0.255.0/24` (256 IP addresses)

### 3. **Spoke 2: Storage & Key Vault VNet Configuration**
   The Storage and Key Vault VNet remains with the same **/16** block allocation.

   - **Storage & Key Vault VNet**: `10.2.0.0/16` (65,536 IP addresses)

#### Subnets within Storage & Key Vault VNet:
   - **Private Endpoints Subnet**: `10.2.0.0/24` (256 IP addresses)

### 4. **Spoke 3: Azure AI Services VNet**
   Introducing the **Azure AI Services VNet** with a **/16** CIDR block, giving it ample space to host private endpoints and other AI-related services.

   - **Azure AI Services VNet**: `10.3.0.0/16` (65,536 IP addresses)

#### Subnets within Azure AI Services VNet:
   - **AI Services Private Endpoints Subnet**: `10.3.0.0/24` (256 IP addresses)
   - Additional subnets for AI resources (as needed).

### 5. **VNet and IP Allocation Summary**

| VNet                        | CIDR Block       | Subnet Name               | Subnet CIDR Block   | Purpose                                        |
|-----------------------------|------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Hub VNet**                 | `10.4.0.0/22`    | Firewall Subnet           | `10.4.0.0/24`       | Network firewall subnet                        |
|                             |                  | Gateway Subnet            | `10.4.1.0/24`       | VPN Gateway, if applicable                     |
|                             |                  | Shared Services Subnet    | `10.4.2.0/23`       | DNS, monitoring, and other shared services     |
| **Databricks VNet**          | `10.0.0.0/14`    | Public Subnet             | `10.0.0.0/16`       | Public-facing resources in Databricks          |
|                             |                  | Private Subnet            | `10.1.0.0/16`       | Databricks worker nodes and services           |
|                             |                  | Private Endpoints Subnet  | `10.0.255.0/24`     | Private endpoints for Databricks               |
| **Storage & Key Vault VNet** | `10.2.0.0/16`    | Private Endpoints Subnet  | `10.2.0.0/24`       | Private endpoints for Storage and Key Vault    |
| **Azure AI Services VNet**   | `10.3.0.0/16`    | Private Endpoints Subnet  | `10.3.0.0/24`       | Private endpoints for AI services              |

### 6. **Routing and Peering**
- **VNet Peering**: Peer the **Hub VNet** with the **Databricks**, **Storage & Key Vault**, and **Azure AI Services** VNets.
- **Firewall Rules**: In the hub’s firewall, set rules to allow traffic between the Databricks VNet and the other spokes, including Azure AI Services and Storage & Key Vault VNet. Ensure all necessary communication is controlled and flows through the firewall.

### 7. **DNS and Private Link**
- Use **Private DNS Zones** for each VNet to ensure private resolution for services like Azure AI, Storage, Key Vault, and Databricks.
- **Private Link** ensures that all traffic between your resources (e.g., AI services, Storage, Key Vault, and Databricks) stays within the Azure backbone.

This new allocation provides more IP space for the Hub VNet and introduces a dedicated VNet for **Azure AI Services**, ensuring your architecture remains scalable and secure.
