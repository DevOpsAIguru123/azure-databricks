To separate networks for Azure Databricks, AI resources, Storage Accounts, Azure Key Vault (with private endpoints), and other resources within your hub-and-spoke VNet model, follow these steps:

### 1. **VNet Architecture**
   - **Hub VNet**: This should continue to contain shared services, like the firewall, DNS servers, and a VPN gateway, if applicable. Ensure the firewall has appropriate rules for traffic filtering and forwarding between spokes.
   - **Spoke VNets**: Each resource should be deployed within separate spoke VNets for logical isolation. For example, separate VNets for Azure Databricks, AI resources, and Key Vault.

### 2. **Private Endpoints**
   - **Storage Account and Key Vault**: Enable private endpoints for both Azure Storage and Key Vault within their respective spokes. This ensures the resources are only accessible via the private IPs in your network, avoiding exposure to the internet.
     - When you create a private endpoint for a resource, it automatically creates a private IP within the subnet where it's deployed.
     - Ensure that DNS is set up properly to resolve the private endpoints through Azure Private DNS Zones or custom DNS servers.

### 3. **Azure Databricks Setup**
   - For **Azure Databricks**, ensure that itâ€™s deployed within its own spoke VNet. Databricks can be connected to the hub via a peering connection. Ensure the proper NSG (Network Security Group) rules are set up to allow traffic to and from the necessary services (e.g., Storage, Key Vault).
   - Configure private link endpoints to restrict Databricks traffic to resources like the storage account and key vault over the Azure backbone.

### 4. **Firewall Rules and NSG**
   - In the **hub**, configure the firewall to allow traffic between the VNets and ensure that it's appropriately restricted. For example, only allow traffic to the necessary endpoints like Storage and Key Vault from the Databricks VNet.
   - On the **spoke VNets**, apply **NSG rules** to restrict traffic based on IP ranges, protocols, and ports. For example:
     - Allow inbound traffic from the Databricks VNet to Storage/Key Vault over specific ports.
     - Allow outbound traffic from Databricks to only permitted IP ranges or resources like the AI services.

### 5. **VNet Peering**
   - Ensure **VNet peering** between the spoke VNets and the hub VNet, with appropriate routing and firewall rules. Disable transitive routing to ensure that traffic between spokes only passes through the hub (unless absolutely necessary).
   - If you require communication between spokes (e.g., Databricks and Storage Account), enforce this through peering and firewall rules in the hub.

### 6. **Azure AI Resources**
   - If using Azure Cognitive Services or OpenAI, these can either be deployed in a separate spoke VNet or through **private endpoints** within the same spoke as Databricks.
   - Use **Private Link** to ensure that communication with these resources is through private IP addresses, avoiding public internet exposure.

### 7. **DNS Configuration**
   - Use **Azure Private DNS Zones** for private endpoints to resolve names like `*.privatelink.blob.core.windows.net` for storage and `*.privatelink.vault.azure.net` for Key Vault.
   - Link the DNS zones to the relevant VNets (Databricks, Storage, AI, etc.) so they resolve correctly within the network.

By keeping resources separated into spokes, using private endpoints, and enforcing traffic control through firewalls and NSGs, you maintain both security and isolation for each service in the hub-and-spoke model.
