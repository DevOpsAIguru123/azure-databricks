Let's reduce the CIDR blocks for the **Azure AI Services VNet** and the **Storage & Key Vault VNet** while ensuring sufficient IP addresses for their workloads. Here's the revised CIDR allocation plan:

### **1. Hub VNet (Shared Services)**
   - **Hub VNet CIDR**: `10.0.0.0/22` (1,024 IP addresses)
   
#### Subnets within Hub VNet:
   - **Firewall Subnet**: `10.0.0.0/26` (64 IP addresses)
   - **Gateway Subnet (optional)**: `10.0.0.64/26` (64 IP addresses)
   - **Shared Services Subnet**: `10.0.0.128/25` (128 IP addresses)

### **2. Spoke 1: Azure Databricks VNet**
   - **Databricks VNet CIDR**: `10.1.0.0/14` (262,144 IP addresses)

#### Subnets within Databricks VNet:
   - **Public Subnet**: `10.1.0.0/16` (65,536 IP addresses)
   - **Private Subnet**: `10.2.0.0/16` (65,536 IP addresses)
   - **Private Endpoints Subnet**: `10.1.255.0/24` (256 IP addresses)

### **3. Spoke 2: Azure AI Services VNet (Reduced)**
To reduce the size of the Azure AI Services VNet, we can allocate a **/20** CIDR block, which still provides ample room for growth but with fewer IP addresses.

   - **Azure AI Services VNet CIDR**: `10.3.0.0/20` (4,096 IP addresses)

#### Subnets within Azure AI Services VNet:
   - **Private Endpoints Subnet**: `10.3.0.0/24` (256 IP addresses)
   - **Additional Subnets**: Can be added as needed for AI services.

### **4. Spoke 3: Storage & Key Vault VNet (Reduced)**
To reduce the size of the Storage & Key Vault VNet, we can allocate a **/20** CIDR block as well, which is smaller than the previous /16 block but still provides room for future services.

   - **Storage & Key Vault VNet CIDR**: `10.4.0.0/20` (4,096 IP addresses)

#### Subnets within Storage & Key Vault VNet:
   - **Private Endpoints Subnet**: `10.4.0.0/24` (256 IP addresses)
   - **Additional Subnets**: Can be created for other services as needed.

### **6. Key Adjustments**

- **Hub VNet**: Allocated a **/22** block with **1,024 IP addresses** for shared services.
- **Databricks VNet**: Kept the larger **/14** block to ensure sufficient space for thousands of VMs.
- **Azure AI Services VNet**: Reduced to a **/20** block with **4,096 IP addresses**.
- **Storage & Key Vault VNet**: Reduced to a **/20** block with **4,096 IP addresses**.

### **7. Summary**

This revised CIDR allocation plan significantly reduces the IP space for both the **Azure AI Services VNet** and the **Storage & Key Vault VNet** while still leaving enough room for growth. The **Databricks VNet** retains a large space due to its need to accommodate thousands of VMs, while the **Hub VNet** is right-sized for shared services with a smaller **/22** block.

This configuration ensures efficient IP usage while maintaining scalability across all spokes.
