Subject: Security Checklist for Databricks Platform – Request for Review and Prioritization for Upcoming VAT Testing

Dear [Recipient’s Name],

I hope this email finds you well.

Based on my current understanding, I have completed the attached security checklist for the Databricks platform. However, I would appreciate it if you could review the document and advise if I have misfilled any sections or missed any key elements that need to be included.

Additionally, could you please provide guidance on which security items should be prioritized for implementation during the upcoming VAT testing? This would help us ensure we focus on the most critical areas.

Thank you in advance for your time and assistance.

Best regards,
