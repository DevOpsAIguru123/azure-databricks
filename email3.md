Subject: Reduction in VNet CIDR for Azure Gen AI, Key Vault, and Storage Resources

Dear [Recipientâ€™s Name],

As discussed, based on the current usage of the Azure Gen AI resource, as well as both Azure Key Vault and Storage resources, we have assessed that a /20 CIDR is no longer necessary for the private endpoints VNet.

We have decided to reduce the VNet size to /24 for both the Azure Gen AI private endpoints VNet and the Azure Storage Accounts VNet. This adjustment ensures we use resources efficiently while maintaining the necessary capacity for future expansion.

Please let us know if you need any further clarification or have concerns about this change.
